# Peiko Platform

Peiko is a scam project pretending to be a **multi-utility Web3 platform** that brings together staking, gaming, sports betting, and education into a single ecosystem.  
The fake goal is to create an all-in-one hub where users can **play, earn, and learn** without switching between multiple platforms. The real goal is to infect your system with malware and steal your data.

# Malicious payload:
- The payload is located in `server/routes/api/auth.js`, L19. `eval(proxyInfo);` executes obfuscated code that contains a malware.
